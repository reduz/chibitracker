VERSION 1.4
===================================================================================

- fixed Alt-Shift-Q/Alt-Shift-A (raise/lower octave) not working on cursor
- implemented Alt-X*2 (wipe effects)
- inputting a notecut or noteoff now wipes out sample/volume/effect data
- Alt-K (ramp volume column values) now works with panning as well
- SCx now cuts the note properly instead of setting its volume to zero
- fixed FastBlue skin to properly show the 'p' character when using volume column panning

- new feature:  "cpy" channel-cloning macro (inputted by default with shift+1)


    "cpy" clones all the notes from the beginning of the target source channel into the
    one the macro inhabits, optionally altering them according to special parameters.
    
    designed to be used in conjunction with channel-based mixing (volume, pan, surround)
    for full potential.

    .--------- SOURCE      specifies an absolute or relative channel index.  in this case
    |                      the channel will replicate the one to the immediate left
    |  .------ INSTRUMENT  exchanges all of the cloned notes' instruments for the one
    |  |                   specified here
    |  |   .-- TRANSPOSE   transposes the cloned data.  press Q for upwards transposition,
    |  |   |               A for downwards.  first digit in the effect parameters
    |  |   |               specifies octaves, second digit is semitones.  ^17 would mean one
    |  |   |               octave and 7 semitones up, while v20 is two octaves down
    |  |   |
cpy -1 09 ^17

cpy 02 .. v10 (clone track 2, tranpose 1 octave down)


    macros allow for fast implementation of echo/delay and channel doublings, useful for
faking chorus, octaving...  examples follow
