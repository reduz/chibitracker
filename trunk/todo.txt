2. I opened up a 1 pattern loop song of mine and and played it from the
start. then i clicked play pattern only and it played pattern 0 of a
different song (angry_pony_blues by decibelter i think)

2a. if i change patterns while my 1 pattern song is loaded it displays the
patterns from angry pony blues and plays it at the the tempo of MY loaded
song. it turns out it NEVER displays the 1 pattern of my 1 pattern song when
I load it. other 1 pattern songs ive written load/display/play correctly

3. not sure if it is a bug, but when a song ends any un-stopped notes will
continue to play. (I am used to modplug where when the song starts over it
starts as if being played for the first time)

4. clicked on a sample once after maximizing/restoring window repeatedly
while playing 2-minute-show and it closed, this problem has occured multiple
times in the same conditions. further testing shows that
maximizing/restoring didnt play a role, as it crashed when i click on ANY
sample while the song is playing

4a. on a different song (1channel) click samples slowly was fine, but then i
clicked on them fast, going between many samples fast and it crashed. this
problem has been repeated ONLY when the song is playing. after further
testing, this ALWAYS HAPPENS for any song while it is playing. This error
also occurs for zooming in on samples


[01:11] <coda> cleanup samples didn't cleanup the samples
[01:12] <coda> they're all still there

[02:38] <CategoryApl> in the sample window it doesn't sound when testing
sample play, but in the instruments tab it does - vol of rtpiano
[02:44] <reduz> in linux and unixes, it's normal that folders are sorted by
case sensitivity
